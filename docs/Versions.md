# WDL Versions

This document is a more concise view of the [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md). It is a chronological list of all the major differences between each successive WDL version. Note that `draft-1` is not covered because it has been fully deprecated and is not supported by any runtime implementations. Also note that `draft-3` is functionally equivalent to `1.0` and so is not covered separately.

⚙️ denotes a change that affects the parser

## Draft-2 to 1.0

*   ⚙️ Version statement required (as of draft-3)
*   ⚙️ Structs
*   ⚙️ For both tasks and workflows, unbound inputs must be within the `input {}` block
    *   Declarations outside input block cannot be overridden
    *   As a consequence of this, the way workflow inputs are calculated differs between the two specs - refer to the “Computing Inputs” sections for details
*   The workflow `output` section is optional in both specs, but the 1.0 spec clarifies that the output section is required in a workflow called as a sub-workflow.
*   Task command section
    *   ⚙️ Placeholders can begin with `~` rather than `$`
    *   ⚙️ Placeholders in heredoc-style command (`command <<< >>>`) may only use the `~{}` style placeholder
    *   `command <<< >>>` with `~{}` placeholders is strongly preferred to avoid any mis-parsing of bash variables
    *   In Draft-2 it was allowed to specify only one of the `true/false` options in a placeholder - the other option evaluated to empty string. In 1.0, both options are required.
*   `meta` and `parameter_meta` are allowed to contain number, boolean, object, or array values in addition to strings
*   Standard library
    *   `size` can be computed for certain compound types

### Non-features

These are features that appear in either or both of the Draft-2 and 1.0 specs that are here explicitly specified as non-features _i.e._ consider these sections of the spec(s) as redlined.

* Both Draft-2 and 1.0 mention a `loop` (or `while`) construct. It appears in both the Draft-2 and 1.0 Hermes grammars. However, it was never supported in Cromwell, and it is dropped in 1.1.
* ⚙️ Wildcard syntax in the output section in Draft-2 is deprecated, and is dropped in 1.0. Parsers are not required to support this syntax in order to be considered compliant.

### Open Questions

These items are ambiguous in either or both of the Draft-2 and 1.0 specs - whether or not they should be considered part of the spec will probably be determined by whether they are implemented in Cromwell.

* Coercion of Map to Object - 1.0 does support this, but I _think_ Draft-2 does not support this.
* The Draft-2 spec mentions a `quote` placeholder option once, but it is never referred to again. The Hermes grammar does not enumerate the allowed options. It is definitely not supported in 1.0.
* The 1.0 spec says that optional inputs with defaults are allowed, whereas the Draft-2 spec does not say one way or the other.
* The Draft-2 spec says that an optional variable whose value is unspecified will evaluate to the empty string. The 1.0 spec does not say how a variable with an unspecified value is evaluated - I am guessing it is an error?

## 1.0 to 1.1

* ⚙️ Introduces `None` value for explicitly declaring an optional parameter as undefined.
* ⚙️ Introduces a new notation for `Struct` literals
* The `Object` type is now deprecated - `Struct`s should be used instead
* Adds support for relative imports
* ⚙️ Adds new "pass-through" syntax for call inputs
* ⚙️ Adds new `after` keyword for making explicit dependencies between calls
* Formally defines the standard runtime attributes
  * `container` is added as an alias of `docker` - the use of `docker` is deprecated
  * `container` now supports image names in URI form (e.g. `docker://repo/img:tag`) and assumes `docker://` by default
* Added the following new functions to the standard library:
  * min
  * max
  * suffix
  * quote
  * squote
  * keys
  * as_map
  * collect_by_key
  * sep
  * unzip
* Makes explicit that the `sub` function supports POSIX Extended Regular Expressions (EREs)
  * Support for other regular expression formats is deprecated
* Formally defines the JSON input and output formats
  * Includes the ability to override runtime attributes in the input JSON
* Makes explicit that unsatisified task inputs should not be allowed when running workflows
  * Introduces the `allowNestedInputs` attribute that can be used in the workflow `meta` section to explicitly allow unsatisfied task inputs
* Deprecates:
  * Use of `file://` imports
  * Placeholder options (`sep`, `true/false`, and `default`)

## 1.1 to development

* ⚙️ Introduces the `Directory` type
* ⚙️ Restricts the `runtime` section to only the standard attributes
  * `container` is now a required runtime attribute
* ⚙️ Adds a `hints` section for arbitrary runtime hints
* ⚙️ Removes the `Object` type and the `read_object*` and `write_object*` functions
* ⚙️ Removes placeholder options (`sep`, `true/false`, and `default`)
